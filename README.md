The purpose of this app was to learn how to create a really beautiful, vibrant page utilizing basic CSS and creating a series of slides using vanilla javascript.

The UX (and because of this, the UI) is simple: the user either views the directions for the quiz or starts the quiz. If the user starts the quiz, and series of questions are shown to the user one-by-one, until the user answers them all, at which point the user is given his or her score and is asked if he/she wants to play again.
