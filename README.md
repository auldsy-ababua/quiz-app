# The Greatest Quiz Ever Made

### _URL_:<br>
http://auldsy-ababua.github.io/quiz-app/

### _SUMMARY_:<br> 
This app was my first experience building a 'full' front-end experience in jQuery.<br>

The purpose of this app was to learn how to create a really beautiful, vibrant page utilizing basic CSS and creating a series of slides using vanilla javascript.<br>

The UX (and because of this, the UI) is simple: the user either views the directions for the quiz or starts the quiz. If the user starts the quiz, a series of questions are shown to the user one-by-one, until the user answers them all, at which point the user is given his or her score and is asked if he/she wants to play again.<br> 

The quiz is composed of intentionally child-level questions about animal anatomy. I chose this route to make it easy for the user to quickly run through the quiz and get all right, all wrong, and partially wrong answers to test out the feedback feature at the end of the quiz. 

### _FUTURE FEATURES_:<br>
1. Add in additional questions, allowing the user to retake the quiz with different questions randomly generated.
2. Perhaps cull questions from a relevant API for endless fun. 

### _TECHNOLOGY USED_:<br>
1. Client-side: HTML5, CSS3, JS
2. Server-side: NA
